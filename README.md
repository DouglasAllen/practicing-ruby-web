== Practicing Ruby

Sorry for how bad this README is, we will surely improve it in time. Right now
this app is publicly available primarily for the sake of transparency, but
there is very little code in here specific to practicingruby.com, so we
definitely want to generalize it eventually. Do feel free to email
**gregory@mendicantuniversity.org** with any questions you have about this app.
