    Thank you for subscribing to Practicing Ruby! As a new subscriber,
    you might be wondering how this journal works and what you can
    expect from it. The following notes will hopefully answer some of your
    questions.
    
  %p 
    %b Practicing Ruby is a library, not a blog.
    Most of the articles published here are not time sensitive in nature,
    and for that reason you shouldn't feel obligated to read new articles
    as soon as they come out. Instead, just set aside some weekly time
    for enjoying this service and approach the materials at your own
    pace.

  %p
    %b New articles will typically be released on Tuesdays.
    The exact time they are published may vary, but I will do the best I can
    to maintain a regular schedule. To help keep the publishing schedule
    sustainable, there will be a two week break between each volume, and
    a one week break after every three weeks of publishing.

  %p
    %b All articles will use the latest stable release of standard Ruby, unless otherwise noted.
    At the time of writing (2012-04-23), that is Ruby 1.9.3. That having been said, most of the content
    will be relevant regardless of what Ruby version or implementation you are using day
    to day.

  %p
    %b If you are unhappy with Practicing Ruby in any way
    you can cancel your account and I'll provide a refund for your
    current month upon request. Unsubscribe links can be found at the
    bottom of each weekly update you have received from Practicing Ruby.
