%p Right now Practicing Ruby is transitioning payment providers. So what does that mean for you?

%p Until we are ready to make the switch, you get full access to the full site free of charge. Once we are ready to begin accepting payments again, we'll ask you to give us your payment information but won't retroactively charge your account. Not a bad deal, right?

%p Your account is now set up, which means that you now have access to everything Practicing Ruby has to offer. You can start by #{link_to 'browsing through our library', library_path} or reading a #{link_to 'randomly selected article', random_article_path}. If you have any questions, please send an email to #{link_to 'gregory@practicingruby.com', 'mailto:gregory@practicingruby.com'}.
