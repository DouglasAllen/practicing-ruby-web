Shucks! Your last payment to Practicing Ruby didn't work! Here is what the bank
said:

"<%= @charge.failure_message %>"

We tried charging your card ending in <%= @charge.card.last4 %> which expires on
<%= "#{@charge.card.exp_month}/#{@charge.card.exp_year}" %>. If this card is no
longer valid, please update it by visiting the following URL and clicking
'Update your credit card':

<%= billing_settings_url %>

If you aren't sure why your payment failed don't hesitate to get in touch with
us so we can help you out.
